1. To demonstrate the practical implementation of positive and negative edged Counters using the Verilog hardware description language.

2. To enable learners to simulate and analyze the behavior of Countersusing software tools.

3. To foster a deeper understanding of how Counters can be used to build more complex sequential circuits.
